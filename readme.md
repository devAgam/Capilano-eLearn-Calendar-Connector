# Capilano University eLearn Calendar Connector
## Why 
While Capilano has a great eLearn system, it lacks a calendar feed for students to subscribe to. This project aims to solve that problem by providing a calendar file for students to automatically add their deadlines to their calendars.

## How
This project uses html parsing to extract the data from the eLearn website and then converts it to a calendar file. The calendar file is then compiled into a blob file and created as a downloadable file.

## Usage
As of now the project is not approved on Google Chrome Web Store, but as soon as its published on the store, it will be available for download. Until then, you can download the project and load it as an unpacked extension.

## Warning
This style of calendar file is not supported by all calendar applications. It is recommended to use Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

This Project uses the standard .ics files so there will be a file downloaded to your computer, but you can just open and add it your calendar just with a simple double click.

Since, the files are generated on the fly, the calendar file will not be updated if the deadlines are changed. You will have to download the file again to get the updated deadlines.

This Project is not affiliated with Capilano University in any way.

*The Project only support Google Chrome as of now, firefox support will be added if their is a positive feedback on the chrome version*.
